# Computer Graphics: Vectors, Matrices and Quaternions

Download the contents of the [lab](./lab) directory. In its contained "core" folder, there are three JavaScript files with skeletons for the Matrix, Vector and Quaternion classes. Complete these classes. All incomplete methods include commented descriptions regarding what the methods should do.

You'll run the lab the same way that you did the previous lab: run `node server.js` in the lab directory and then navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser. This time, instead of a display, you'll see a sequence of tests run in the console (right click, inspect, and select the console tab to see the tests).

Note that this lab will span three weeks. In the first week, we will discuss vectors and matrices, and most of the utilities in these two classes should be covered. Then, we'll take a detour to discuss the World Transform in 2D space, and we'll do a small lab covering that topic. Finally, we'll discuss quaternions, to cover the remainder of this lab.
